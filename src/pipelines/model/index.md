# Pipeline model

We have four types of pipeline models:

 * [*Pipeline*](pipeline.md) defines one or more [*stages*](./stage.md) to be executed in the same order as they are defined
 * [*Stage*](stage.md) defines one or more [*jobs*](./job.md) to be executed in parallel at the same time
 * [*Job*](job.md) defines one or more [*steps*](./step/index.md) to be executed in the same order as they are defined
 * [*Step*](step/index.md) defines a work item to execute
