# Roadmap

Things we are looking forward to:

 * ***Translation support.*** We'll include a full user interface to create and modify translations.
 * ***User support in created apps.*** Support to require user identity to use forms created by our software.
 * ***Improved user management.*** We're planning to add Organizations and complete multi-user environment in the UI.
 * ***Backend support.*** Design your own backend APIs in the UI and configure to execute [Pipelines](./pipelines/index.md).
