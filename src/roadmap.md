# Roadmap

Things we are looking forward to:

 * ***Translation support.*** We'll include a full user interface to edit translations.
 * ***User support for end-users.*** Support to require user identity to submit forms.
 * ***Improved user management.*** We're planning to add Organizations and complete multi-user support.
 * ***Backend support.*** Design backend APIs and configure to execute [Pipelines](./pipelines/index.md).
